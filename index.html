<h4 id="care-principles">CARE Principles</h4>
<p>The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance were developed by the International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group, part of the Research Data Alliance.They were designed to complement the FAIR data principles and describe key aspects of working with Indigenous communities and cultures and their data, information, and knowledge. The CARE principles are:  Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics.  Published in <a href="http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-043">Data Science Journal in 2020</a>.</p>
<h4 id="controlled-vocabularies">Controlled Vocabularies</h4>
<p>Collections of terms used to improve the consistency and effectiveness of data entry, storage, retrieval, and interoperability.  Their use removes ambiguity, makes implicit information explicit, and the increases interpretability of the data.  See <a href="www.doi.org/10.3789/ansi.niso.z39.19-2005R2010">NISO Z39.19</a>, and applications such as <a href="https://medin.org.uk/data-standards/controlled-vocabularies">MEDIN</a>.</p>
<h4 id="data-catalog">Data Catalog</h4>
<p>A persistent, findable, searchable virtual location that stores metadata but not data, and facilitates searching and finding data across multiple data repositories or data storage locations.</p>
<h4 id="data-documentation">Data Documentation</h4>
<p><em>Noun:</em> Metadata, READMEs, data dictionaries, and other materials that describe the data and the processes that created the data.<br />
<em>Verb:</em> The process of creating the information that enables the sharing, use and reuse of data and software packages.</p>
<h4 id="data-governance">Data Governance</h4>
<p>The legal structures and policies necessary to insure the desired management of data assets.  This includes structures for how decisions are made about data and how people and processes are expected to behave in relation to the data.</p>
<h4 id="data-inventory">Data Inventory</h4>
<p>A data inventory is a fully described record of data assets. The inventory records basic information about a data asset including its name, contents, update frequency, use license, owner/maintainer, privacy considerations, data source, and other relevant details.

<h4 id="data-license">Data License</h4>
<p>A legal framework that specifies how data can be accessed, used, and reused.</p>

<p>The knowledge that enables one to understand and communicate about data in an appropriate and meaningful way.  This includes the principles, practices, and methods used throughout the data lifecycle.</p>
<h4 id="data-management">Data Management</h4>
<p>The tasks involved with documenting, maintaining, updating, and publishing data.</p>

<h4 id="data-provenance">Data Provenance</h4>
<p>The detailed records that keep the history about the data from creation/origin, through transformations and modifications, to products.  Data provenance is transparent, supports trust in the reliability of data, and allows reproducibility.</p>
<h4 id="data-repository">Data Repository</h4>
<p>A persistent, findable, searchable entity that provides infrastructure for long-term storage and access to data.  It should provide for data publication by data holders, as well as access for using/reusing data.  Datasets in a repository are described with metadata that provides essential information about the data and enables efficient search and reuse.  It should also employ unique identifiers, have redundancy, and have clear guidelines for what types of data it accepts.  May or may not be federated with other repositories.  See the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-32001-4_59-1"><em>Encyclopedia of Big Data</em></a>.</p>
<h4 id="data-sharing-agreement">Data Sharing Agreement</h4>
<p>A legal agreement between two or more parties that defines the terms and conditions for sharing non-public data.</p>
<h4 id="data-stewardship">Data Stewardship</h4>
<p>The actions involved in supporting, promoting, and guiding the use and reuse of data throughout the data lifecycle.</p>
<h4 id="derived-data">Derived Data</h4>
<p>Existing data that have been processed, combined, assembled for the purposes of analysis, visualization, or publication.  Derived data often refers to data resulting from the compilation or assembly of raw data into analysis-ready data to answer a particular question.  Sometimes also referred to as processed data, though that often has more limited meaning.  Examples include text or data mining, and compiled datasets.</p>
<h4 id="doi">DOI</h4>
<p>Digital Object Identifier.  A unique identifier for a publication, including journal articles, datasets, software packages, etc.</p>
<h4 id="erddap">ERDDAP</h4>
<p>A data server and broker that gives you a simple, consistent way to download subsets of scientific datasets in common file formats.  It is used by organizations around the world to expose their data online.  More information is available from <a href="https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/information.html">NOAA</a>.</p>
<h4 id="experimental-data">Experimental Data</h4>
<p>Data that are generated and/or collected under controlled conditions set up by experimental design or test method.  They are often reproducible, but that can be expensive or time consuming.  Examples include gene sequences, animal abundance, plant physiological responses, chromatograms.  See <a href="https://dmptool.org/general_guidance">DMPTool definitions</a>.</p>
<h4 id="fair-principles">FAIR Principles</h4>
<p>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable.  First published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">Scientific Data in 2016</a>.</p>
<h4 id="knowledge-graph">Knowledge Graph</h4>
<p>A digital structure that uses a graph model to formally represent entities (knowledge) and their properties, types, and relationships.  Can include an ontology that allows humans and machines to understand and reason about its contents.  Ref: <a href="https://medium.com/@stephenmdyoung/what-is-a-knowledge-graph-69861fbe09fb">Stephen Young on Medium</a></p>

<em>Federal Government Definition:</em> Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource (NISO 2004, ISBN: 1-880124-62-9)</p>
<h4 id="observational-data">Observational Data</h4>
<p>Data that are captured in real-time, typically in nature outside a lab.  They are usually irreplaceable and therefore the most important to safeguard.  Examples include sensor readings, telemetry, survey results, and images. See <a href="https://dmptool.org/general_guidance">DMPTool definitions</a>.</p>
<h4 id="ontology">Ontology</h4>
<p>A definition of terms and the relationships between them, often depicted as a flow chart.  Frequently used to align term definitions in order to create a common vocabulary.

Adapted from the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GovLab/data-collaboratives/master/source/static/files/existing-practices-report.pdf">GovLab</a>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>Data that are formatted, documented, and shared in ways that make them understandable, interpretable, and obtainable by people other than the original data collector/holder.  See also the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR definition</a>.</p>
<h4 id="schema">Schema</h4>
<p>An outline, diagram, or model of the structure of different types of data.<br />
